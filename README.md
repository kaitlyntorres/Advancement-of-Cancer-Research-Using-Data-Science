# Objective
For our Masters Capstone, we wanted to conduct research to try and prove how and why Data Science is essential to the advancement of cancer research.

# Usage
Open the .ipynb file and you can run all the code there. The folders do contain .xlsx, .csvs, and .htmls that you can open and run. They are split up by USA, NY, and FL, which were our three main focus points.

# Inspiration
As students and now developers, we've been taught that the sky is the limit in regards to how much of an impact code can actually have on peoples' lives. When given the opportunity to use our imagination, we both knew that we wanted to create a project that will prove to others as to how significant code is anywhere, not just in the technological field. With cancer being such an uncontrollable disease that impacts many lives, we wanted to discover/show how data science can find patterns of different types of cancer in given locations which may help us as a whole understand why certain cancers are so prevalent in certain areas. We also wanted to show how when data is accessible, there's many research avenues to explore and research contributions that can be made. Making sure people are aware of trends in their families, communities and the importance of being vigilant against such a horrendous disease.
